    "original_answer": "Randy has 20 \u2013 12 = <<20-12=8>>8 years until he is 20.\nHe must practice 10,000 hours / 8 years = <<10000/8=1250>>1,250 hours a year to become an expert.\nThere are 52 weeks in a year \u2013 2 weeks of vacation Randy plans to take = <<52-2=50>>50 weeks of practice for Randy.\nRandy will practice Monday \u2013 Friday, which is 5 days a week, so 50 weeks x 5 days = <<50*5=250>>250 days of practice each year.\nRandy will need to practice 1250 hours / 250 days = <<1250/250=5>>5 hours each day.\n#### 5",
