    "original_answer": "The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is the same as the height of the sunflowers from Packet B + 20%. If Y represents the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, Y + 0.20Y = the height of sunflowers from Packet A.\nWe know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches = Y + 0.20Y or 1.2Y.\nTo figure out Y, we would divide both sides of the equation by 1.2, like this: 192 / 1.2 = 1.2Y / 1.2 or 160 = Y.\n#### 160",
