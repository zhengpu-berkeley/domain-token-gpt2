    "original_answer": "The number of people who took only wine is the difference between the number of people who took wine and those who took wine and soda which is 26 -17 = <<26-17=9>>9 people\nIn the same manner, the number of people who took only soda is 22-17 = <<22-17=5>>5 people\nTherefore the total number present is the sum of those who took wine only, those who took soda only and those who took both which is 9+5+17 = <<9+5+17=31>>31 people\n#### 31",
