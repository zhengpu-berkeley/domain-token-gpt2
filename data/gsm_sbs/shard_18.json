    "original_answer": "At the highest setting, it vibrates 1600*.6=<<1600*.6=960>>960 vibrations per second faster than the lowest setting\nSo it vibrates at 1600+960=<<1600+960=2560>>2560 vibrations per second\nMatt uses it for 5 minutes so that is 5*60=<<5*60=300>>300 seconds\nThat means he experienced 2560*300=<<2560*300=768000>>768,000 vibrations\n#### 768000",

    "question": "Gail has two fish tanks. The first tank is twice the size of the second tank. There are 48 gallons of water in the first tank. She follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. If she keeps two-inch fish in the second tank and three-inch fish in the first tank, how many more fish would Gail have in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another?",
