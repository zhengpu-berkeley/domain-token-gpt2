    "question": "After tests in California, the total number of Coronavirus cases was recorded as 2000 positive cases on a particular day. The number of cases increased by 500 on the second day, with 50 recoveries. On the third day, the total number of new cases spiked to 1500 with 200 recoveries. What's the total number of positive cases after the third day?",
    "original_answer": "When 500 new cases were recorded after the tests, the total number of positive cases increased to 2000 cases + 500 cases = <<2000+500=2500>>2500 cases.\nWith 50 recoveries, the total number of cases reduced to 2500 cases - 50 cases = <<2500-50=2450>>2450 cases.\nOn the third day, with 1500 new cases, the total number of cases became 2450 cases + 1500 cases = <<2450+1500=3950>>3950 cases.\nIf 200 people recovered from the virus, the total number of people with Coronavirus became 3950 cases - 200 cases = 3750 cases\n#### 3750",

    "question": "Jack is stranded on a desert island. He wants some salt to season his fish. He collects 2 liters of seawater in an old bucket. If the water is 20% salt, how many ml of salt will Jack get when all the water evaporates?",
    "original_answer": "First find how many liters of the seawater are salt: 2 liters * 20% = <<2*20*.01=.4>>.4 liters\nThen multiply that amount by 1000 ml/liter to find the number of ml of salt Jack gets: .4 liters * 1000 ml/liter = <<.4*1000=400>>400 ml\n#### 400",
