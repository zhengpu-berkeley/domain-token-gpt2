    "question": "Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?",
    "original_answer": "There are four sides to a rectangle, the width is W and so the length is 2W, and we can put that in this equation: W + W + 2W + 2W = 30 feet.\nIf we add the sides together, we get 6W = 30 feet.\nTo find W, we divide both sides by 6, like this: 6W / 6 = 30 feet / 6, so W = 5 feet.\n#### 5",

    "question": "Tara has been planning to buy a laptop which costs $1000. A computer shop accepts payment in installments of $65 per month provided that a 20% down payment is made. If Tara wants to pay an additional $20 for the down payment, how much will her balance be after paying for 4 months?",
    "original_answer": "Tara has to make a $1000 x 20/100 = $<<1000*20/100=200>>200 down payment.\nSince Tara wants to pay $20 more for the down payment, her total down payment will be $200 + $20 = $<<200+20=220>>220.\nSo her remaining balance payable over a year is $1000 - $220 = $<<1000-220=780>>780.\nTara has to make a monthly payment of $780/year / 12 months/year = $<<780/12=65>>65/month.\nThe total cost of her payments for 4 months is $65/month x 4 months = $<<65*4=260>>260.\nTherefore, Tara's balance after 4 months is $780 - $260 = $<<780-260=520>>520.\n#### 520",
